# CV App

This is a simple CV app that I made to learn React. It is a single page app that has a toggleable edit mode.

In edit mode, you can edit the text in the CV. The changes are saved to local storage, so they will persist even if you refresh the page. Once you are done editing, you can toggle edit mode off and the changes will be reflected in the CV.

In non-edit mode, you can view the CV. The CV is responsive, so it will look good on mobile devices.

Inspired by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-cv-application).
